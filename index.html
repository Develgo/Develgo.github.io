                A place where I share my passion for the Swift programming language
            </div>
            <p>
                Ever since the advent of SwiftUI, developing apps for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS has never been easier.
                I'm really passionate about using Apple's various platforms as well as building apps for them.
                As I continuously experiment and learn, I'd like to share that knowledge with you and help grow the amazing Swift community.
            </p>

                The name Develgo is a combination of the words develop and go, signifying the development of software for a mobile world.
                However, with the power of SwiftUI, it doesn't take much effort to make a view that works on the iPhone in your pocket or Apple Watch on your wrist to work on the Mac sitting on your desk or even the Apple TV in your living room.
