    <p>
        This is a site where I document all of my software development tips, tricks and basically anything that'll help me remember how to do something specific.
        It's my personal knowledge base and reference guide. Here I'll include everything from mundane terminal commands to articles on SwiftUI as an example.
        Hopefully it evolves into something that everyone will find useful.
